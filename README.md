SOA-based Enterprise Configuration Management
=============================================

Large Service-Oriented-Architecture (SOA) based enterprise applications are generally 
dynamic, complex, multi-tiered, distributed across multiple machines (e.g. a data center). Management
of such applications is a challenge and XML-based configuration files are widely used in the 
management of such applications.

Goal of this project includes specific management tasks like **deployment of applications**,
**selective restart** of applications after a reboot and **capacity planning**. 

Such tasks require efficient querying, transformation and persistence of configuration 
data which is the main goal of any enterprise management tool.

Objective
=========
The main objective of this project is to get experience with **tree data structures** (implemented
as XML documents) and (in-memory) **searching algorithms**.

Technologies used:
==================
1. Mainly project is developed using **Java**.
2. For XML parsing, we are using **SAX Parser**.
